# Benchmarking Vision based Grasp Detection algorithms

Research under Prof Berk Calli (Manipulation and Environmental Robotics Lab, Worcester Polytechnic Institute)

This repository is built on top of [Franka Panda](https://github.com/cdbharath/franka_panda "Franka Panda") manipulation pipeline repository. 
Refer [Vision based Grasp Detection Algorithms](https://github.com/cdbharath/learning_based_grasp_synthesis "Vision based Grasp Detection Algorithms") for sample algorithms to test in this benchmark environment 

## How to run:
```
roslaunch benchmarking_grasp test_benchmark.launch
rosrun benchmarking_grasp test_benchmark_pipeline.py
```
